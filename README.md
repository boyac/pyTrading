## Formula
- Leveraged investment are amplified compared to an otherwise identical unleveraged investment. Gains are higher and losses are worse, so it is a high risk/high reward strategy. The return on a leveraged investment can be calculated as:
- R_li = R_ui + [(D/E) * (R_ui - c)]
- R_li = (Ending value with leverage - starting value with leverage - borrowing cost) / start value with leverage

-- R_li: leveraged return  
-- R_ui: unleveraged return  
-- D/E : borrowing ratio  
-- c   : cost of borrowing
