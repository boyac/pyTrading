Based on the market consensus, I project the S&P 500 to fluctuate between 4200-5200 points in 2024, with a potential overshoot up to 5500 points. With an approximate 10% rise already seen, my buy-hold strategy suggests entering at pullbacks to 5000 points, 4600-4800 points, and 4300 points. My plan is to hold until the market reaches or nears 5500 points or by year-end, targeting a 6-8% profit potential.
