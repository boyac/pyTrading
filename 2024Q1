```python
Based on the market consensus, I project the S&P 500 to fluctuate between 4200 and 5200 points in 2024, 
with a potential overshoot up to 5500 points. With an approximate 10% rise already seen on 2024/03/26, 
my buy-and-hold strategy suggests entering at pullbacks to 5000 points if the market has strong support, 
4600-4800 points as a neutral entry point, and 4300 points as a delightful entry point this year. 
My plan is to hold until the market reaches or nears 5500 points or until year-end, 
targeting a 6-8% profit potential.
